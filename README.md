# README #

The initial setup of the extension is done using [chrome-extension Yeoman generator.](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension)
[ES2015 can be used](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/), please read the generator's [Readme](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-chrome-extension/blob/master/readme.md) for info about the tooling.

### What is this repository for? ###
For the long lost bookmarks that may never be seen again. The intention is to have a tool to resurrect them when a moments break presents itself.

Further down the line I would like to build out the functionality a little more to aid with
* Organise your bookmarks one roulette at a time, delete those that you no longer care to have.
* Mark the bookmarks you have seen and do not want to come back via roulette.
* Tbcâ€¦

### How do I get set up? ###

* See the Yeoman readme (link above).
